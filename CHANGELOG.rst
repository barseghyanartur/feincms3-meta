`Next version`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added more steps to the usage instructions.
- Converted the thing into a real package so that we can bundle
  translations etc. This also means that import paths have changed. The
  ``MetaMixin`` has to be imported from ``feincms3_meta.models``,
  ``meta_tags`` and ``meta_tags_html`` from ``feincms3_meta.utils``.
